  <h1>Jamaat Abi Sibtayn</h1>

  <p>
    Jamaat Abi Sibtayn is a Shia community rooted in love, loyalty, and service to
    the Ahl al-Bayt (as). Our purpose is to preserve remembrance, uphold faith,
    and serve the community through sincere intention, unity, and khidmat.

  <p>
    We strive to keep hearts connected to Karbala, to truth, and to spiritual
    responsibility — quietly, sincerely, and consistently.
